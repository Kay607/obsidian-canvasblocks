# Canvas Blocks

Integrate python snippets with Obsidian Canvas.

Select a script node and run the command `Canvas Blocks: Execute Canvas Command` to execute it

Overlap a script node with another node to use it as input to the script

Use edges for additional parameters by pointing the arrow into the script node

## Usage
![QRCodeExample](https://github.com/Kay607/obsidian-canvasblocks/assets/54263177/fe01115b-3b0a-449e-b09b-1c8ec78a4334)

Scripts can either be written as a text node in canvas or in a markdown file

The code is inside of a code block using the language `pycanvasblock`

```pycanvasblock
file = get_parameter_file("r")
text = file.read()
file.close()

file = get_parameter_file("w")
file.write(text.upper())
file.close()
```

### Examples
Example scripts can be found at [Examples](examples)

Some of these example scripts may output data into the plugin's data folder which can be altered in settings (default `Assets/CanvasBlocks`). This folder must be created for the scripts to work correctly

## Writing Scripts

The plugin exposes several variables to the script to allow it to process parameters. All node data is provided in the [JSON Canvas](https://jsoncanvas.org/) format used by Obsidian Canvas in the form of python objects

`script_data` A copy of the script being executed is provided

`parameter_data` The node data of the parameter node (the node which overlaps with the script in the canvas). If none is overlapping, this will be `{}`

`arrow_parameters` An list containing all nodes with an edge pointing into the script

`vault_path` The absolute path to the root directory of the vault

`plugin_folder` A local path from the vault root. This is set in the settings but defaults to `Assets/CanvasBlocks`. This can be used for storing data generated by scripts

`has_parameter` A boolean value for whether there is a parameter node (only considers overlapping nodes, not ones linked by edges)

---

As well as this, the plugin contains a library for useful functions to interface with the canvas such as these and more

`install_dependency` Checks if a python module is installed and installs it with `pip` if it is not

`create_text_node` Creates a text node in the canvas

`create_file_node` Creates a file node in the canvas

For more information on this, read the provided library at [Canvas Blocks Python Library](resources/canvasblocks-python-lib.py)
